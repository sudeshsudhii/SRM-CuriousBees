# CuriousBees V2 — Phase 2 Monorepo Engineering Quality Audit Report

This report presents a comprehensive audit of the **CuriousBees V2** monorepo workspace. It focuses on repository health, dependency integrity, cross-platform stability, developer onboarding, and production deployment readiness.

---

## 🔍 1. Repository Health Report

### 1.1 Type-Safety (TypeScript)
* **Status**: **Excellent (Passed)**
* **Audit Details**: 
  * Strict mode (`"strict": true`) has been enabled on the backend NestJS REST API (`apps/api/tsconfig.json`). 
  * Implicit `any` errors, missing null/undefined safety assertions, and loose callbacks in startup files (e.g., [main.ts](file:///Users/maddy/Current%20Project/CuriousBees_V2/apps/api/src/main.ts) and [firebase-admin.service.ts](file:///Users/maddy/Current%20Project/CuriousBees_V2/apps/api/src/infrastructure/firebase/firebase-admin.service.ts)) have been resolved.
  * Running `npm run typecheck` validates both frontend Next.js and backend NestJS compilation, exiting with code `0`.

### 1.2 Code Quality & Linting
* **Status**: **Excellent (Passed)**
* **Audit Details**:
  * Headless, non-interactive lints are fully functional. 
  * Resolved blocking Next.js build issues on CI/CD (specifically `react/no-unescaped-entities` and `@next/next/no-html-link-for-pages`) by adding a custom [.eslintrc.json](file:///Users/maddy/Current%20Project/CuriousBees_V2/apps/web/.eslintrc.json) for the Next.js workspace.
  * Running `npm run lint` completes cleanly with zero errors.

### 1.3 Service Connection Health
* **Status**: **Healthy (Passed)**
* **Audit Details**:
  * The `/api/health` endpoint evaluates the NestJS process, a PostgreSQL ping via Prisma, and a Redis ping via `ioredis`.
  * The custom CLI tool [scripts/check-health.js](file:///Users/maddy/Current%20Project/CuriousBees_V2/scripts/check-health.js) executes on all major operating systems, returning live connection status:
    * API Gateway: `ONLINE`
    * PostgreSQL DB: `CONNECTED`
    * Redis Queue: `CONNECTED`

## 📄 2. Missing Documentation Report

Prior to Phase 2, several operational areas lacked formalized documentation. We audited these gaps and created corresponding modules:

| Identified Documentation Gap | Resolution Artifact / Document | Purpose & Contents |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Troubleshooting Guide** | [docs/troubleshooting.md](file:///Users/maddy/Current%20Project/CuriousBees_V2/docs/troubleshooting.md) | Resolving port conflicts (`EADDRINUSE`), Prisma out-of-sync schemas, BullMQ Redis loops, and Firebase Admin environment key parsing errors. |
| **Dev Mode Bypass Guide** | [docs/development_mode.md](file:///Users/maddy/Current%20Project/CuriousBees_V2/docs/development_mode.md) | Standardizes the bypass flags (`DEVELOPMENT_MODE`), describes the mock local developer user structure, and maps how client-header tokens are passed. |
| **Staging/Prod Deployment** | [docs/deployment_test_production.md](file:///Users/maddy/Current%20Project/CuriousBees_V2/docs/deployment_test_production.md) | Setup procedures, environment variables matrix for frontend/backend, Prisma DDL command guidelines, and disaster rollback plans. |
| **Release Changelog** | [CHANGELOG.md](file:///Users/maddy/Current%20Project/CuriousBees_V2/CHANGELOG.md) | Chronological version history (`v0.1.0` through `v0.3.0`) following Keep a Changelog rules and Semantic Versioning. |

## 📦 3. Dependency Audit

### 3.1 Workspace Scoping
* Monorepo uses **npm workspaces** mapped in the root [package.json](file:///Users/maddy/Current%20Project/CuriousBees_V2/package.json):
  * App: `apps/web`, `apps/api`
  * Packages: `packages/types`, `packages/shared-utils`, `packages/constants`, `packages/ui`
* Sharing between modules is done using standard npm symbolic link definitions (local dependencies prefixed with `*` or direct package names in workspace files).

### 3.2 Cross-Platform Command Security
* Verified that no OS-specific CLI tools (like `rm`, `mkdir`, `export`) are present in root or workspace package scripts.
* Standardized script execution tools:
  * **`cross-env`**: Used to declare inline environment configurations safely on Windows CMD/PowerShell and POSIX shells.
  * **`rimraf`**: Replaced all instances of `rm -rf` to ensure cache cleanups work on Windows command prompts.

### 3.3 Dependency Vulnerabilities
* Ran `npm audit` check. The active packages are aligned, and lockfile symlinks compile cleanly without duplicate dependency resolution traps.

## 💻 4. Cross-Platform Compatibility Report

To ensure the monorepo is ready for team developers working on different workstations:

| Platform | Verified Actions | Compatibility Status & Resolution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **macOS** | Dependency install, Dev server run, Health querying. | **Fully Compatible**. Built-in AirPlay Receiver conflicts on ports 3000/5000 documented. |
| **Linux** | Build execution, Database seeding, Testing. | **Fully Compatible**. Handled via standard node script triggers. |
| **Windows** | Clean resets, Prisma generation, concurrently dev runs. | **Fully Compatible**. Shell issues resolved by using `cross-env`, `rimraf`, and `node` runners. |

### Case-Sensitivity Risks
All internal imports use exact, lowercase-to-uppercase matching (e.g., standardizing on lower/kebab-case filenames). This prevents build breaks when deploying from case-insensitive filesystems (Windows/macOS) to case-sensitive filesystems (Linux staging/production hosts).

---

## 👥 5. Team Onboarding Report

We established Git standards and PR formats to ease development across multiple contributors:

### 5.1 Issue & PR Templates
* Created **[PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](file:///Users/maddy/Current%20Project/CuriousBees_V2/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)**: Includes checklists for database migrations, testing runs, and manual approval triggers.
* Created **[bug_report.md](file:///Users/maddy/Current%20Project/CuriousBees_V2/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)**: Structures bugs with system metadata (Node version, OS version, DB status) and step-by-step reproduction guidelines.
* Created **[feature_request.md](file:///Users/maddy/Current%20Project/CuriousBees_V2/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)**: Aligns features with user problem statements and proposed implementation blueprints.

### 5.2 Release & Versioning Strategies
* Releases are tracked inside [CHANGELOG.md](file:///Users/maddy/Current%20Project/CuriousBees_V2/CHANGELOG.md).
* Team commits must comply with the Conventional Commits specifications (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`) to automate version bump logs.

## 🚀 6. Deployment Readiness Report

### 6.1 Build Reliability
* Running `npm run build` triggers:
  * `npm run build --workspace=apps/api` (generates the standalone NestJS output in `apps/api/dist`)
  * `npm run build --workspace=apps/web` (triggers Next.js compiler, optimizing static chunks and routes)
* Both compile cleanly on clean directory runs.

### 6.2 Environment Isolation
* Local configurations (`.env`) are strictly git-ignored.
* Example settings are mirrored in `.env.example` templates to prevent credential leaks.
* Development mode bypass controls are isolated using `DEVELOPMENT_MODE` environment flags.

### 6.3 Database Migration Strategy
* Deployment builds should execute `npx prisma migrate deploy` prior to launching the updated backend containers. This ensures zero-downtime schemas are pushed forward safely.
