Our lab in the Computing Technologies department has recently set up a cluster of 4x NVIDIA H100 GPUs for fine-tuning custom models on institutional datasets. 

We are currently looking to collaborate with faculty members in the **Biotechnology & Bioengineering** department who need GPU cycles to accelerate protein fold sequencing or drug discovery workflows. 

If your PhD scholars have computationally demanding deep learning workloads (written in PyTorch or JAX), please reach out. We would love to co-author and share these resources to produce high-impact joint publications.

I am drafting a proposal for the upcoming **DST-SERB Core Research Grant** focusing on creating high-throughput genomic sequencing sensors integrated directly on-chip using silicon photonics.

This is a highly cross-disciplinary endeavor requiring:
1. **ECE experts** with experience in silicon waveguide fabrication and optical resonators (Dr. Ramesh's team).
2. **Biotech experts** with experience in bio-functionalizing chip surfaces to bind DNA molecules (my team).
3. **Computer Science experts** to design fast signal decoding algorithms directly running on raw optical sensor data.

We are holding an initial brainstorming session in the ECE Seminar Hall next Friday at 2:00 PM. Please reply to this thread if you are interested in joining the proposal!

Best,
